    <h1>Make Your Own Web Server</h1>
    <p>The task for this assignment was to make a node.js web server from "scratch" i.e. no frameworks such as express.</p>
    <p>The server has to handle different file types and serve up error pages when there is something that is not handled or
    another type of error occurs.</p>
    <p>Please not all test pages were created by my teacher Allan McDonald</p>
