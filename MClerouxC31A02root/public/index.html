    <h1>Make Your Own Web Server</h1>
    <p>The task for this assignment was to make a node.js web server from "scratch" i.e. no frameworks such as express.</p>
    <p>The server has to handle different file types and serve up error pages when there is something that is not handled or
    another type of error occurs.</p>
    <p>Please not all test pages were created by my teacher Allan McDonald</p>
    <h3 class="lighter">Try some pages to test out what the server handles: </h3>
    <a href="bin/stocks.xml?rating=outperform">Searches in XML file and returns the first entry that matches the query.</a><br>
    <a href="cars/make/Toyota">Searches a JSON file and returns the entries that match the query.</a><br>
    <a href="Test2GifImage.html">A GIF.</a><br>
    <a href="TestText.txt">A text file.</a><br>
    <a href="TestXML.xml">An XML file.</a><br>
    <a href="formPostMethod.html">A form that posts.</a><br>
    <a href="doesnotexist">A page that doesn't exist.</a><br>
    <a href="afile.that">A file that is not handled.</a><br>
